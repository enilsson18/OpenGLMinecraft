Made in visual studios 17 with opengl GLFW (32 bit) and glad framework. 
The libraries are included in the LibResources folder and are already linked to the project settings. If there are library errors, it means you might be compiling the x64 version and not the x86 (32 bit) version.
If for some reason the program does not boot, check if the opengl files are linked properly there are many tutorials online.
